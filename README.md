# Examples in D

I enjoy working in D, but it seems to be made by and for 
experienced professional programmers. In many ways this
is a great thing because it is a great, powerful
language. But I think it is more dififcult to learn
than Python, R, or MATLAB, as many scientist/engineer 
types like myself learned first. I don't think it's as
hard for computer science folks to learn D because they
are well-acquainted with compilers, setting up 
compile-time dependencies and libraries, and an 
object-oriented approach. Even though Python can be object
oriented, it's often not explicitly used as such 
by scientists, or so it seems to me.
I am just re-learning D after learning
a lot more about programming since my first encounter.
D has a lot of new features and supporting software, first
and foremost the D package manager [`dub`](https://code.dlang.org/). 
Check the dub site for many interesting packages. There is a 
[REPL](https://github.com/dlang-community/drepl). The main hangup for me is to
learn to do things the D way. Luckily it's fun and powerful 
to write code the D way, even if it's different from the way many scientists 
learn to code.

For now this repo will house example code I've put together. Maybe later there
will be more info for beginners on how to get started with D, or maybe more
advanced tutorials, say, on random number generators with `mir.random` or 
some of the other useful stuff in the broader `mir` library.

Also, [DlangScience](https://github.com/DlangScience).
